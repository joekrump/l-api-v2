l-api-v2 is a SPA frontend interface for an API using JWT for authenication, built with [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) and [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/). The API server is currently private, therefore, you will only be able to navigate to public routes at the moment. However, you may look at how the authentication is setup by checking out auth.js and Login.js.

The dev environment for the app was created using [react-create-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), an excellent tool for generating a skeleton React app with all the basic configuration taken care of. Visit the url above for more details.
